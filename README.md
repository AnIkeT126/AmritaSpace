# AmritaSpace

This Repo holds links for all the repositories where the code developed for the completion of the Final Year Project of Amrita Space: Advanced CMS Enterprise Powered by a Deep Learning Model resides.

This project is completed by Aniket Mishra (CH.EN.U4CYS20004) and Jayanta Sikdar (CH.EN.U4CYS20031) under the supervised guidance of Dr. Udhaya Kumar S.

## Descirption

This description provides the need
and design of Amrita Space which is made to be an in-house Content Management System. This
Content Management brings together problems, the students in Amrita are facing because of lack
of a centralized repository of authorized content like exam papers, answer keys, answer sheets,
books, PPT(s), lab records, research papers etc. This description also provides an analysis of Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) techniques, with a specific focus on the bidirectional LSTM model,
in transforming printed or handwritten text into digital formats, with applications spanning
document digitization and text analysis that is another core component of the Project.
We stress on creating a two-vertical Content Management System for teachers and students
respectively, who are the primary users of the app and provide an over-the-top secure application,
tested and validated by a cloud service provider. To facilitate the conversion of handwritten text
to a digitized document, and we assess the performance of these OCR methods using a diverse
dataset, considering metrics such as accuracy, speed, and adaptability to various text types and
languages. Our comparative analysis sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of each
approach, providing valuable insights into their practicality in real-world scenarios.
In the realm of information retrieval, an innovative approach involves harnessing the power of
bidirectional LSTM for semantic search which capitalizes on deep neural networks to unravel the
subtleties of textual content, enabling a profound comprehension of its meaning. Bidirectional
LSTM, with its ability to grasp text in a manner resembling human language. Noticing the failure
of these models on a bundle of images when used via a PDF and high Character Error Rate (CER)
we migrate to the profound use of Cloud Vision API, that was a pet project of Alphabet Inc. and
layer this over another strip to be used by the teachers and students so that the CMS transcends
the boundaries that might be set in a real world sceanio.
